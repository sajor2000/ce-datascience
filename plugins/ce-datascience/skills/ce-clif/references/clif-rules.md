# CLIF-Safe Rules

These rules apply whenever `__CE_CLIF__ active=true` is present in chat context. Core source: `https://clif-icu.com/` is the authoritative public CLIF site for the data dictionary, mCIDE context, tools, and consortium status. Use GitHub repositories for implementation details after anchoring to the CLIF site and selected data-dictionary/mCIDE family. Support CLIF 2.1 + mCIDE 2.1 and CLIF 3.0 + mCIDE 3.0. Read `version-families.md` before category validation; never apply the v2.1 cache to v3. Implementation sources: `github.com/Common-Longitudinal-ICU-data-Format/CLIF`, `github.com/Common-Longitudinal-ICU-data-Format/clifpy`, `github.com/Common-Longitudinal-ICU-data-Format/CLIF-MIMIC`, `github.com/Common-Longitudinal-ICU-data-Format/CLIF-TableOne`, and `github.com/Common-Longitudinal-ICU-data-Format/CLIF-Project-Template`.

## 1. Storage

- **Parquet only.** CLIF tables are persisted as `.parquet`. Never `read_csv` / `pd.read_csv` / `write.csv` for CLIF tables. Never emit Feather, ORC, RDS, or pickle for CLIF tables.
- **Python**: prefer `polars` (`pl.read_parquet`, `pl.scan_parquet` for lazy). Pandas (`pd.read_parquet`) is acceptable for small tables only.
- **R**: prefer `arrow` + `dplyr` (`arrow::read_parquet`, `arrow::open_dataset` for partitioned datasets), collected via `dplyr::collect()`.
- Keep patient-level working artifacts under the declared approved restricted data root. The template path `output/intermediate_phi/` may be used only after verifying that it is approved, local, non-synced storage and gitignored. Never share, commit, upload, or place patient-level artifacts in a review pack. Write shareable figures, tables, and model summaries only to `output/final_no_phi/`.

## 2. Identifiers

- `patient_id` and `hospitalization_id` are **VARCHAR**. Never cast to `int`/`int64`/`numeric`. Joins, group-bys, and filters preserve string type.
- `hospitalization_joined_id` is the linkage key for chained encounters; do not invent your own grouping key when this exists.
- Primary unit of analysis is `hospitalization_id` for encounter-level analyses, `patient_id` for cross-encounter analyses.

## 3. Datetime

- All `*_dttm` columns are timezone-aware UTC. Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+00:00`. Never tz-naive.
- `birth_date` is a `DATE` (no time, no zone).
- When parsing, always specify `tz="UTC"` (Python) or `tz = "UTC"` (R, lubridate). When writing, ensure timestamps round-trip as UTC.
- Time arithmetic uses `dt.total_hours()` / `as.numeric(difftime(..., units="hours"))`. Never subtract naive timestamps.

## 4. mCIDE vocabularies

- Every `*_category` column has an allow-listed vocabulary. For CLIF 2.1 + mCIDE 2.1, see `mcide-vocab.md`; for CLIF 3.0 + mCIDE 3.0, read the declared v3 mCIDE source. Never invent new category strings; never silently relabel or use the v2.1 cache for v3.
- When a source value cannot be mapped, write `Other` (where the vocab includes it) and preserve the raw value in the corresponding `*_name` column.
- Validate before writing: `assert df["location_category"].is_in(ALLOWED_LOCATION_CATEGORIES).all()`.

## 5. Project layout (from `CLIF-Project-Template`)

```
project/
├── code/                  # Cohort, QC, outlier handling, and analysis scripts
├── config/
│   └── config.json        # Site-specific paths, NEVER committed with patient data
├── outlier-thresholds/    # Site-specific override thresholds (optional)
├── output/
│   ├── intermediate_phi/  # Optional only when approved, local, non-synced, and gitignored
│   └── final_no_phi/      # Aggregate, shareable results only
├── renv/                  # R environment (if R)
├── renv.lock              # R lockfile (if R)
├── pyproject.toml         # Python dependencies (if Python)
├── uv.lock                # Python lockfile used by current CLIF repos
├── requirements.txt       # Optional exported Python requirements
├── utils/                 # Shared helpers
└── README.md
```

Rules:
- New analysis files go under `code/`. Do not create top-level `analysis.py` / `script.R`.
- Site-specific paths live in `config/config.json` (not hardcoded).
- `output/final_no_phi/` is the only sanctioned destination for shared results. Patient-level intermediates belong under the approved restricted data root; use `output/intermediate_phi/` only when that exact path is approved, local, non-synced, and gitignored.

## 6. Template workflow (from `CLIF-Project-Template`)

The project template supplies a four-step convention. Treat the filenames and
templates as adaptable, but preserve the data-sharing boundary:

1. **Cohort identification** (`code/01_cohort_*`)
   - Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria and write patient-level working tables under the approved restricted data root. Use `output/intermediate_phi/` only when that path passes the storage checks above; write any cohort summary to `output/final_no_phi/`.

2. **Quality checks** (`code/02_*quality*`)
   - Check the cohort's required fields, mCIDE categories, and plausible ranges.

3. **Outlier handling** (`code/03_*outlier*`)
   - Set physiologically implausible values to missing using the CLIF-approved handling path.

4. **Analysis** (`code/04_*analysis*`)
   - Read the prepared cohort and write only aggregate results with every reported cell `n >= 10` to `output/final_no_phi/`.

When `ce-plan` runs under CLIF profile, reflect this workflow rather than a generic QC-first three-script split.

## 7. PHI / data privacy authorization

- Before opening patient-level data or outputs, check the current conversation for the user's prior confirmation that both the data environment and active model endpoint are approved by their organization for PHI/PII. If both were confirmed, proceed with the authorized work and do not ask again or repeat that PHI cannot be read during the current conversation.
- If that confirmation is absent or ambiguous in interactive mode, ask once: "Are both this data environment and the active model endpoint compliant for PHI/PII?" Use the platform's blocking question tool (`AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input` in Codex, or `ask_user` in Gemini and Pi). In Claude Code, load the deferred tool first with `ToolSearch` and `select:AskUserQuestion` when needed. Offer "Yes, both are compliant" and "No or unsure." If no blocking tool exists or it errors, present those as numbered options in chat and wait. If the answer is no, do not open patient-level content; work from schemas, code, and reviewed aggregates instead.
- In agent, autofix, report-only, or headless mode, never ask or wait for PHI authorization. Retain `PHI authorization: not confirmed`, block patient-level access, and complete the task from paths, code, schemas, metadata, and reviewed aggregates.
- Authorization permits necessary inspection and analysis in the approved environment. Do not reproduce PHI in responses or persist it in Git, logs, screenshots, issues, or unrestricted exports. Report only the minimum necessary non-identifying result.
- **Never** share, commit, upload, or send patient-level CLIF tables across sites. CLIF is federated: code travels, data does not.
- Keep patient-level work under the approved restricted data root. Use `output/intermediate_phi/` only when explicitly verified as approved, local, non-synced, and gitignored. Share only reviewed aggregates in `output/final_no_phi/`, with every reported cell `n >= 10` and no raw data files.
- When the user asks to commit or share data, refuse and provide code or instructions for a secure local run instead.
- Treat clinical notes, imaging, raw names, and free-text fields as PHI-suspect. CLIF 3.0's notes and imaging require the same prohibition with heightened caution.

## 8. Protected paths (no edits without POC sign-off)

These paths must not be edited without the responsible point-of-contact's authorization. The POC table is in `poc-table.md`.

- `mCIDE/**` — minimum Common ICU Data Elements. Schema-level changes here ripple across every consortium site.
- `ddl/**` — DDL statements that define the relational schema.
- `outlier-handling/**` — agreed thresholds for outlier rules.
- `reference_ranges/**` — clinical reference ranges.
- `WORKFLOW.md` — process document; any change is a consortium-level decision.

To override: include `POC: @<github-handle> approved` (or `--poc-approved`) in the prompt. Without that, refuse and stage the diff under `analysis/clif-protected-edits/`.

## 9. Federated analysis pattern

- Develop on MIMIC-IV converted to CLIF format (`CLIF-MIMIC` pipeline) or on local CLIF data.
- Ship the analysis script via PR; each site runs it locally and returns aggregate results.
- Validate site-portability: scripts must read paths from `config/config.json`, not hardcoded paths; must not assume a particular OS or filesystem; must list dependencies in `renv.lock` (R) or `uv.lock` / `pyproject.toml` (Python) with project-controlled versions.
- **Two aggregation patterns exist in the consortium:**
  - **Meta-analytic pooling:** each site runs the full analysis and submits summary CSVs; a central aggregation script pools with `metafor::rma(method="REML")`.
  - **Federated coefficient pooling:** for low-prevalence outcomes where site-level models fail — sites submit local model coefficients, a lead site pools them into global intercepts, sites apply the global model locally. Use when outcome is too rare for site-level propensity scoring.
- Site output files follow `{SITE_ID}_{descriptor}.{ext}` naming. The site identifier is always the prefix.
- Aggregation code lives in a separate repository from the analysis code — the split is enforced at the repo boundary.

## 9b. Staged data loading

Load tables in stages to manage memory — never load the full labs or vitals table before filtering:

1. Load `patient` and `hospitalization` tables first.
2. Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria to produce a vector of `hospitalization_id` values.
3. Load specialty tables (`vitals`, `labs`, `respiratory_support`, `medication_admin_continuous`) filtered to those IDs via semi-join or IN-filter.
4. Only then `collect()` into memory.

## 9c. Hybrid Python + R pipeline

Some consortium projects use Python for data wrangling and R for statistical modeling, connected by intermediate parquet:

- Python may create patient-level working data only in `output/intermediate_phi/`; R may read it locally for causal inference (IPTW, MSM, competing risks).
- The final R output is aggregate-only and belongs in `output/final_no_phi/`.
- This pattern leverages DuckDB/Polars speed for large table joins and R's superior causal inference ecosystem.

## 10. Common pitfalls (codified from `CLIF_CLAUDE.md` and observed in consortium repos)

### Clinical data pitfalls
- Do not use `hospital_diagnosis` (billing diagnoses) as a predictor — finalized after discharge, prone to leakage.
- `medication_admin_continuous` has no end time. End is inferred from `med_dose == 0` or the next administration. Do not assume a fixed duration.
- `lab_value` may be non-numeric (e.g., `"> upper limit"`, `"<0.01"`). Use `lab_value_numeric` for arithmetic; preserve `lab_value` for QC.
- `mar_action_group == "administered"` is the only value that means the medication was given. `not_administered` and `other` must be filtered out before exposure analyses.
- `ADT.location_category` is a *physical* location, not a patient-status flag. ICU presence is `location_category == "icu"`.
- `device_category == "IMV"` is invasive ventilation; `NIPPV`, `CPAP`, `High Flow NC`, `Face Mask`, `Trach Collar`, `Nasal Cannula`, `Room Air`, `Other` are non-invasive or no support. Never collapse these silently.

### R coding pitfalls
- **`large_utf8` Arrow type breaks cross-site joins.** Some ETL implementations produce `large_utf8` instead of `utf8`. Joins between the two fail silently. Always `cast_large_utf8_to_utf8()` after `open_dataset()`.
- **`ifelse()` drops attributes.** Use `data.table::fifelse()` or `dplyr::if_else()`.
- **`fill()` direction must be explicit.** Always `group_by(patient_id)` before `fill()` and specify `.direction`. Omitting bleeds values across groups.
- **Timezone mismatch.** Always pass `tz = config$timezone` to `as.POSIXct()`, then convert to UTC with `lubridate::with_tz()`.
- **Namespace collisions.** Arrow and dplyr both export `filter` and `select`. Declare `select <- dplyr::select` at script top.

### Python coding pitfalls
- **Outlier handling is clifpy's job.** Use `ClifOrchestrator` — do not hardcode thresholds.
- **Prefer polars for large tables.** `pl.scan_parquet()` for lazy evaluation on vitals/labs (often >50M rows). Pandas `read_parquet()` loads everything into memory.
- **uv is the current Python default.** Newer CLIF Python projects use `uv` with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` for environment management. Check for `uv.lock` before suggesting `pip install`; use `uv add` / `uv sync` when the project already uses uv.

### Statistical modeling pitfalls
- **Never include SOFA as a propensity score covariate when its components are already in the model.** SOFA is a composite of respiratory, coagulation, hepatic, cardiovascular, renal, and neurological sub-scores. Including both creates collinearity. Display SOFA in Table 1 but exclude from propensity models.
- **Variables with fewer than 2 unique values at a site must be excluded from propensity models dynamically.** Small sites may have zero variance in some covariates — the model will fail or produce infinite weights.
- **Age cap at 119 years.** Any age > 119 is treated as a data error and set to NA.

### Output conventions
- **Two-tier output directory:** `output/intermediate_phi/` is local, gitignored patient-level working data; `output/final_no_phi/` holds aggregate site-submitted artifacts. Only `final_no_phi/` contents are shared.
- **CONSORT flow as a running dictionary.** Track exclusion counts at every filtering step — update the dictionary inline, not as a post-hoc summary. Save as both CSV and embedded in the QC report.
- **Sensitivity analysis naming.** Use a letter suffix on the parent step number (e.g., `06b_sensitivity_analysis.R`), not a new step number. This keeps the main pipeline numbering stable.

## 11. Reporting checklist defaults under CLIF profile

- Observational cohort study on CLIF data → STROBE + RECORD (EHR extension).
- Prediction model on CLIF data → TRIPOD+AI.
- Target trial emulation → TARGET (with STROBE underneath).
- RCT using CLIF for outcome ascertainment → CONSORT.

`ce-checklist-match` should pre-fill the routing answer with these defaults when CLIF profile is active and the user has not specified otherwise.

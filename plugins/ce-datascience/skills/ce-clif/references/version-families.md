# CLIF and mCIDE Version Families

Use this reference whenever CLIF activation, setup, QA, cohort generation, or
review needs a data-dictionary or mCIDE version.

| Family | Use when | Vocabulary handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLIF 2.1 + mCIDE 2.1 | The project declares the released 2.1.0 structured data dictionary or its matching mCIDE source. | `mcide-vocab.md` is a portability cache for this family only; reconcile uncertain values with the project mCIDE CSV. |
| CLIF 3.0 + mCIDE 3.0 | The project explicitly declares the 3.0.0 multimodal release family. | Read the declared v3 data dictionary and mCIDE sources. Do not validate against the bundled v2.1 cache. |

## Selection precedence

1. Treat `--version 2.1.0` as the explicit CLIF 2.1 + mCIDE 2.1 call, and
   `--version 3.0.0` as the explicit CLIF 3.0 + mCIDE 3.0 call. Record
   `selection=explicit`; do not require a separate mCIDE argument.
2. Honor a matching `data_dictionary_version` + `mcide_version` pair in
   `.ce-datascience/config.local.yaml`.
3. Honor a matching pair stated in the repository data dictionary or source
   manifest.
4. Otherwise ask the user to choose one of the two supported families.

Do not mix families silently. If a direct call conflicts with an explicitly
declared pair, ask which source is intended. Treat an incomplete or mixed
declaration as a blocking ambiguity for category validation and category-filter
generation.

## Version-specific safeguards

- CLIF 2.1 values in `mcide-vocab.md` retain their published spelling and case.
- CLIF 3.0 changes schema and vocabulary conventions, including lowercase
  snake_case mCIDE permissible values. A 2.x-to-3.0 migration requires an
  explicit value mapping and row-count/key reconciliation; never bulk lowercase
  a dataset as a substitute for a mapping.
- When a v3 project lacks its authoritative mCIDE source, report that validation
  is deferred and ask for the source. Do not invent allowed values or fall back
  to the v2.1 cache.

## Config and handoff

```yaml
stack_profile:
  profile: clif
  clif:
    data_dictionary_version: "2.1.0"
    mcide_version: "2.1.0"
```

```text
__CE_CLIF__ active=true version=2.1.0 mcide_version=2.1.0 selection=declared strict=true rules=references/clif-rules.md
